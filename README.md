#Docker basics
What is Docker?

Definition: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows you to package an application along with all its dependencies into a container.

Analogy: The tutorial uses the image of a fish carrying blocks (containers) to illustrate Docker's ability to transport software and its dependencies.

Problem Solver: Docker addresses the "dependency hell" issue where applications work fine in one environment (e.g., a developer's machine) but fail in another (e.g., testing or production) due to mismatched software versions or configurations.

Quote: "Docker is a platform with packages and application and all its dependencies together in the form of a container."

The Problem Docker Solves (Historical Context)

Traditional Workflow Issues: A developer codes an application (e.g., using Python 2.7) on their home computer. When this application is moved to another machine with a different Python version (e.g., 3.7), it breaks due to mismatched dependencies.

Inconsistency: Different environments with different dependencies cause major problems in software development.

Docker Solution: Docker resolves this by creating containers that package the application with its specific dependencies, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

Docker Containers

Packaging: A container encapsulates an application and all its dependencies, like specific software versions and libraries.

Isolation: Containers provide isolated environments.

Multiple Environments: Docker enables running different software versions on the same system using containers (e.g., Java 8 and Java 11 in separate containers).

Quote: "With Docker, you can develop a project, put it in a container with dependencies, and then transfer the container anywhere. You don't have to worry about whether it will run in testing, staging, or production environment."

Docker Architecture

Hardware Layer: The foundation is the physical hardware of a machine.

Host OS: The operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) is installed on the hardware.

Virtualization vs. Docker: Docker uses containerization, which provides lightweight isolation by sharing the host OS kernel instead of creating full operating systems within a host (as in VMs).

Docker Engine: Manages containers using a client-server architecture.

Containers: Created, run, managed, and removed using Docker Engine.

Key Docker Concepts

Docker File: A text document that contains instructions for assembling an image.

Docker Image: A template for creating containers, specifying all necessary components.

Docker Container: A running instance of an image.

Analogy: The image is like a class, while the container is an object instantiated from it.

Quote: "The running image is actually a container. It is the entire package that runs the application."

Docker Workflow (Docker File to Container)

Docker File Creation: Define settings and dependencies.

Image Building: Execute commands in the Dockerfile to build an image.

Container Creation: Running the image creates a container with all dependencies.

Docker Installation

Windows Focus: Installation on Windows 11 (similar steps for Windows 10) using WSL2.

System Requirements: Enable WSL2 and ensure Virtualization is enabled in BIOS.

Commands: wsl --install and Docker Desktop setup.

Command Line Testing: docker version to verify installation.

Basic Docker Commands

docker version - Check Docker version.

docker pull - Download an image from Docker Hub.

docker images - List available images.

docker search - Find images on Docker Hub.

docker run - Create and start a container.

docker ps - List running containers (docker ps -a to see all containers).

docker exec - Execute commands inside a container.

docker inspect - Get container details.

docker stop - Stop a container (docker restart to restart).

docker rm - Remove a stopped container (docker rmi to remove an image).

docker push - Upload a custom image to Docker Hub.

Building Custom Images

Process: Creating a custom image using a Dockerfile.

Examples: Custom images for Ubuntu, Java, and Python applications.

Project Structure: Folder structure for creating images.

Dockerfile Setup: Key directives like FROM, RUN, COPY, WORKDIR, CMD, and EXPOSE.

Build Command: docker build -t <image-name> .

Run Command: docker run <image-name> to test the new image.
